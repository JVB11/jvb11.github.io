> I was a teaching assistant for both of these courses during the academic years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.

The titles of these courses can be translated into English as 'Physics with elements of mathematics I & II' (I was taught in the first semester, II in the second).
They were introductory physics courses for the first-year students in the bachelor of science in pharmaceutical sciences at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), which were taught in Dutch.[^1]

We started out by refreshing the students' knowledge of (Belgian) secundary education-level mathematics.
Following this introductory chapter, we taught the students the typical introductory physics topics, such as Newtonian mechanics, waves, and the basics of thermodynamics, electrostatics, quantum mechanics and diffusion (among others).
All of these topics were approached with an emphasis on linking physical laws with the pharmaceutical sciences.

[^1]: As I was a native speaker of Dutch and a PhD student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at KU Leuven, I was not eligible to become a teaching assistant for a course taught in English (at the master level, with astronomy-related topics).
