> I gave the Theory of Stellar Oscillations part of the Asteroseismology course organized in the academic year 2025-2026.

Along with a fellow postdoctoral researcher within our group (Theory and Observations of Stars), Dr. Felix Ahlborn, we taught the students the basic theory necessary to understand the oscillations within stars.
Specifically, we looked at how one can perturb the stellar structure equations to obtain the governing adiabatic oscillation equations and delved into asymptotic theory to provide the students with physical insight on the variety of modes propagating inside a star, as well as their predominant propagation regions.
