> I presented the theory part of the Asteroseismology course organized in the academic year 2025-2026, together with Dr. Felix Ahlborn.

Together with my fellow postdoctoral researcher in the TOS (Theory and Observations of Stars) group, Dr. Felix Ahlborn, we taught the students the basic theory necessary to understand oscillations within stars.

We first derived the governing adiabatic oscillation equations by perturbing the stellar structure equations.
We then delved into asymptotic oscillation theory to provide the students with physical insights on gravity and pressure modes propagating inside a star, as well as their predominant oscillation cavities.
